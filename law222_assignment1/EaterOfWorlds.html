            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Eater of Worlds is likely to be the third boss that a player would fight on worlds that contain the <span class="corrupttext">Corruption</span>, following Eye of Cthulhu and Slime King.</p>
            <p>It is a massive worm with dozens of segments, each with their own healthbar</p>
            <p>Every last segment must be destroyed in order to defeat the boss.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since the boss is effectively dozens of different entities mashed together, killing segments that are in the middle will cause the boss to split apart.</p>
            <p>The now separated worms will act independently of each other to attack the player.</p>
            <p>In these isolated worms, the frontmost segment will morph into a head segment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The boss attacks by trying to ram the player with its head segments. Making contact with other segments will deal lesser damage.</p>

            <h2>Spawn Mechanics</h2>
            <p>The Eater of Worlds cannot spawn without direct player action. There are 2 ways to achieve this.</p>
            <p>Breaking 3 Shadow Orbs found inside of the Corruption Biome will cause the boss to spawn.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, an item known as Worm Food can be created and used in the Corruption to spawn the boss.</p>

            <p>This boss does NOT have one overall main health pool.</p>
