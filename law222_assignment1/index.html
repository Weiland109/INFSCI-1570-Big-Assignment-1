        <h2 id="Section1">What is Terraria?</h2>
        <p>Terraria is a game created by Re-Logic in 2011. It has repeatedly received major updates since then, continuing even up to 2025 thus far.</p>
        <p>It is described as being similar to Minecraft, with several distinct differences.</p>
        <p>The most obvious difference is that the game is two dimensional, as opposed to Minecraft being in three dimensions</p>
        <p>However, there are more differences in the gameplay.</p> 
        <p>Minecraft is primarily focused on building & mining, with combat generally being less important.</p>
        <p>Terraria is the opposite. Combat (Against Enemies, not Players) is the primary focus, while building and mining are less important.</p>

        <h2 id="Section2">What is Pre-Hardmode?</h2>
        <p>Pre-Hardmode describes the state of the Terraria world BEFORE the Wall of Flesh has been defeated for the first time.</p>
        <p>Defeating the Wall of Flesh and entering Hardmode will radically change the world, and is considered the mid-point of the game.</p>
        <p>For a boss to be considered Pre-Hardmode, it must be possible for that boss to be spawned in that world using only the resources that can be acquired in Pre-Hardmode.</p>
        <p>Technically some Hardmode bosses can be spawned in a Pre-Hardmode world, but only by using resources imported from a Hardmode world.</p> 
        <p>This cannot be done if you haven't already reached Hardmode in a different playthrough, and therefore doesn't count for the purpose of this listing.</p>

        <h2 id="Section3">Evil Biomes?</h2>
        <p>A standard Terraria world will have one of two possible biomes chosen as that world's 'Evil' biome.</p>
        <p>That decision is made when the world is first created. The player can manually decide which evil a world will have or they can leave it up to chance.</p>
        <p>These biomes are named <span class="corrupttext">'The Corruption'</span> and <span class="crimsontext">'The Crimson'</span>.</p>
        <p>The Corruption's main aesthetics are depicted as rot and disease, while The Crimson's main aesthetics are violence and gore.</p>
        <p>The Corruption is a disease intending to corrupt the world, while The Crimson is a hivemind that wants to consume the world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Eater of Worlds and The Brain of Cthulhu are associated with the Corruption and the Crimson respectively.</p>
        <p>In a standard playthrough, a player will only fight ONE of these two bosses.</p>
