            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Eye of Cthulhu is likely to be the first boss that a player fights in Terraria, though some players may instead fight King Slime first.</p>
            <p>It is a massive demonic eye, similar in design to the 'demon eye' enemies that spawn every night.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At first, the boss will alternate between charging at the player or spawning small demon eyes to attack the player.</p>
            <p>When the boss drops to half health, part of the eye will fall away to reveal a large mouth.</p>
            <p>The boss will then become increasingly aggressive, gaining speed and attack damage as it loses health, until it is defeated</p>

            <h2>Spawn Mechanics</h2>
            <p>If this boss has not yet been defeated in this world, then it is possible for the boss to spawn on its own.</p>
            <p>If any player in the world has 200+ health, then every night there is a chance for the boss to spawn.</p>
            <p>If this happens, a message will pop up in chat saying 'You Feel an Evil Presence Watching You...'.</p>
            <p>This gives the player a minute to prepare before the boss actually spawns in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Alternatively, a player can choose to spawn the boss on their own using an item known as a 'Suspicious Eye' during the night.</p>
            <p>Suspicious Eyes can rarely be looted from chests, or they can be crafted.</p>
            <p>Crafting them requires 6 lenses, an item obtained by killing demon eyes.</p>
